# Hey, I'm Isaiah 👋

**Senior Software Engineer** | 7+ Years Experience | **Product-Focused** | **Front-End Leaning**

I build 0→1 products that solve real problems with beautiful UX and thoughtful branding. I'm obsessed with the intersection of **engineering**, **design**, and **product thinking**—and I sharpen my skills through hackathons and side projects.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Product Engineering**: I don't just write code—I build products. From idea validation to launch, I thrive in the 0→1 phase where every decision matters.
- **Front-End Architecture**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern CSS. I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and developer experience.
- **Branding & Design Systems**: I believe great products need great branding. I design cohesive visual identities, color systems, and component libraries.
- **Full-Stack When Needed**: Supabase, PostgreSQL, serverless functions, Web3 smart contracts—I can handle the backend when the product demands it.
